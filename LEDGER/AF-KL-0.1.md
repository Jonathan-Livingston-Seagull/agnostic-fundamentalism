# AF-KL-0.1 - Kudos Ledger (Collective Achievement Changelog)
**Status:** Draft v0.1 (forkable; revisable via AF-RFC)

## Purpose
Record collective improvements that reduce suffering and/or increase coherence, without creating a score economy, status ladder, or power-allocation system.

## Non-goals
- Ranking individuals
- Allocating money/power/privileges
- “Credit assignment” as ownership

## Core design constraints (anti-Goodhart)
1) No per-person scores
2) No leaderboard
3) No scarce rewards tied to inclusion
4) Evidence-bound entries (checkable claims)
5) Postmortem-shaped culture: failures/rollbacks are first-class achievements

## Eligible entry types
- **Patch:** new process/module/practice that measurably improves outcomes
- **Fix:** mitigation of a failure mode (capture attempt, metric gaming)
- **Rollback:** revert a change that caused harm/distortion
- **Upgrade:** verified improvement in calibration/coordination/repair capacity
- **Kernel Revision:** accepted AF-RFC that changes AF-0 or core modules

## Acceptance criteria (minimum)
Each entry includes:
- Title + date + scope
- Problem statement
- Change
- Evidence (links/provenance)
- Risks & failure modes (including gaming vectors)
- Monitoring steward(s) (not “owners”)
- Review status (approved/provisional/sunset date)

## Required failure quota
Over any rolling 20 entries:
- At least 6 must include a documented failure, rollback, or “we were wrong” correction.

## Attribution (optional, bounded)
- Contributors may be listed, but:
  - no “primary author” field
  - list is alphabetical or by role
  - attribution never implies authority over the kernel

## Entry template
**AF-KL:** `YYYY-MM-DD — <Type> — <Title>`

- **Change:**

- **Risks:**
