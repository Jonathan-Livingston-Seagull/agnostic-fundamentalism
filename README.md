# Agnostic Fundamentalism (AF) — A Civilizational Floor

AF is an attempt to define a *minimum shared baseline* (“the floor”) that people with wildly different religions, philosophies, and political instincts can stand on together - without requiring metaphysical agreement.

**Goal:** maximum inclusion of everyone capable of clearing the floor.

## The Floor (Kernel)
**Protect sentience; grow coherence; hold metaphysics in superposition.**

In normal language:
- **Protect sentience:** treat the capacity for suffering/flourishing as non-negotiable. No cruelty license.
- **Grow coherence:** prefer honesty, evidence, error-correction, and systems that learn.
- **Hold metaphysics in superposition:** on unresolved big questions (free will, ultimate reality, God, etc.), we stay humble - no one gets to use metaphysical certainty to justify coercion or cruelty.

## What this is
A “civilizational BIOS”: a small set of invariants + basic processes that make cooperative society possible among diverse worldviews, and that can be revised transparently over time.

## What this is not
- Not a replacement for anyone’s religion or personal philosophy
- Not a demand for belief in any metaphysics
- Not a points system, purity test, or ideological club

## Who this includes
Any person or community that can operate in shared governance without violating the floor: no cruelty, dehumanization, epistemic monopoly, or suppression of peaceful exit/forking. Metaphysical beliefs are welcome as personal “plugins” so long as public cooperation remains compatible with the floor.

## Who this excludes
Any ideology that violates the floor; no cruelty, dehumanization, epistemic monopoly, or suppression of peaceful exit/forking allowed. This includes (non-exhaustively):
- fascism and variants,
- theocratic/ideological monopolies on truth enforced by coercion,
- systems that depend on dehumanization or cruelty as governance tools.

### Minimum viable reading
- **5 minutes:** README + `CHARTER/AF-0.md`
- **30 minutes (contributor):** + `RFC/0000-rfc-process.md` + `MVP/MVP-SPEC.md`
- **Deep dive:** `BIOS/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `MODULES/*` + `RFC/TEMPLATES/*`

## How to contribute (3 steps)
1) Open an Issue: ask a question or propose a change.
2) If it’s high-stakes, write an RFC using a template in `RFC/TEMPLATES/`.
3) Submit a Pull Request with the proposed text change.

If you’re not technical: you can still contribute by writing, critiquing, and red-teaming ideas in plain language. Someone else can help turn it into a patch.
