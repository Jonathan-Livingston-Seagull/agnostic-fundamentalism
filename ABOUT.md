# About (Steward Note)

I am the initial steward of this repo, not the owner of its truth.
If you can improve this, you should.

I am based in Melbourne, Australia. ADHD, high openness, and strongly biased toward systems thinking and synthesis.
That bias cuts both ways: it helps me connect dots, and it can make me impatient with detail and vulnerable to big-story intoxication.

AF is designed to be forkable and adversarially testable so that my temperament cannot become a bottleneck.
If this project ever requires deference to my persona, it has failed.

If you are here to build a priesthood, a leaderboard, a cult, or a monopoly, please go elsewhere.
If you are here to patch civilization without cruelty, without capture, and without epistemic monopoly, welcome.
