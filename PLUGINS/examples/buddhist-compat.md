# Plugin: Buddhist (AF-Compatible, governance profile)

## Core commitments
- Reduce suffering; cultivate compassion
- Non-harming (ahimsa) and restraint
- Mindfulness and clear seeing (error-correction)

## How it compiles to AF-0
### No cruelty / dehumanization
Cruelty increases suffering and corrodes compassion; it is prohibited.

### No coercive monopoly on truth
Teachings are offered, not enforced. Practice is voluntary; dissent is permitted.

### Peaceful exit/forking allowed
Communities may separate peacefully; attachment to forced unity is treated as a failure mode.

### Provenance for high-stakes public claims
Policy claims rely on evidence and transparent uncertainty; metaphysical claims are not used to coerce.

## Justice stance
Accountability without hatred; emphasize prevention, restoration, and rehabilitation.

## Failure modes & safeguards
- Failure mode: spiritual bypassing (“compassion” used to avoid boundaries).
- Safeguard: humane containment remains real; harm prevention is not optional.
