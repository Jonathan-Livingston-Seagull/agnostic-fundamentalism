# Plugin: Church of Agnostic Fundamentalism (CAF) - AF-Compatible Governance Profile
This document is a worldview plugin. It is not part of the AF-0 floor.
Listing here indicates compatibility intent, not exclusivity and not a claim of authority.

## Core commitments
- Awareness is sacred (treated as the locus of intrinsic value).
- Dominion is the original sin (capture, coercion, humiliation, epistemic monopoly).
- Reason is devotional practice: curiosity, critical thinking, and disciplined doubt.
- Humor is mandatory. Solemnity is an institutional smell.
- Psychedelics are optional: an advanced track or rite of passage for willing adults, not the core.

## How CAF compiles to AF-0 in shared governance
### No cruelty / dehumanization
CAF treats cruelty and humiliation as anti-divine. They are prohibited as governance tools.

### No coercive monopoly on truth
CAF forbids enforced belief. Doubt is part of the covenant. Dissent is protected.

### Peaceful exit/forking
CAF explicitly supports exit, forking, and nonviolent re-association.

### Provenance for high-stakes claims
CAF endorses provenance, uncertainty labeling, red-teaming, and postmortems for public decisions.

### Privacy and autonomy
CAF treats privacy as sacred substrate for autonomy. Auditability must not become surveillance.

## Failure modes and safeguards
- Failure mode: founder worship or guru formation.
  - Safeguard: rotation, recall, no permanent authority, mandatory red teams, and explicit "outgrow this" norms.
- Failure mode: bias-minimization becomes a new purity test.
  - Safeguard: anti-messianic posture. Method over moral superiority.
- Failure mode: sacred language used to coerce.
  - Safeguard: AF-0 public reason symmetry and non-derogation of autonomy.

## Notes
CAF can carry additional cultural scaffolding (emblems, saints, rites) as long as it remains non-coercive and compatible with AF-0 constraints.
