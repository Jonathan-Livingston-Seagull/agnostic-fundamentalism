# Plugin: Panpsychist / Cosmopsychist (AF-Compatible, governance profile)

## Core commitments
- Consciousness/awareness may be fundamental (speculative)
- Moral seriousness about sentience boundaries
- Humility: metaphysics does not override rights

## How it compiles to AF-0
### No cruelty / dehumanization
If sentience is widespread, precaution increases; cruelty is prohibited.

### No coercive monopoly on truth
Metaphysics remains a hypothesis, not a mandate. Dissent is protected.

### Peaceful exit/forking allowed
Pluralism is required; no enforced metaphysical unity.

### Provenance for high-stakes public claims
Public policy uses evidence and uncertainty; metaphysical views cannot coerce governance decisions.

## Justice stance
Accountability without vindictiveness; prevention/repair/rehab prioritized.

## Failure modes & safeguards
- Failure mode: over-attributing mind and diluting priorities.
- Safeguard: graded precaution + evidence-seeking + sunset reviews for boundary decisions.
