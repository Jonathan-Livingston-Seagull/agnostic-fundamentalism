# Plugin: Christian (AF-Compatible, governance profile)
This document is not theology. It is a governance compatibility statement.

## Core commitments
- Love of neighbor; mercy; humility about human certainty
- Truthfulness and repentance (error-correction)
- Human dignity and protection of the vulnerable

## How it compiles to AF-0
### No cruelty / dehumanization
Cruelty, torture, and humiliation are incompatible with love of neighbor and human dignity.

### No coercive monopoly on truth
Faith may be preached and practiced, but belief is not compelled. Dissent is not punished.

### Peaceful exit/forking allowed
Communities may peacefully associate or separate without violence, bounded by sentience protections.

### Provenance for high-stakes public claims
Public policy claims are argued with reasons and evidence proportional to stakes; revelation is not used as a coercive override.

## Justice stance
Accountability is required; vindictiveness is prohibited. Emphasize repair, restoration, and rehabilitation where possible.

## Failure modes & safeguards
- Failure mode: using “certainty” to justify coercion.
- Safeguard: superposition stance in public governance; humility + audit + protected dissent.
