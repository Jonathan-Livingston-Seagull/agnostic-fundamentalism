# Plugin: Secular Humanist (AF-Compatible, governance profile)

## Core commitments
- Human (and sentient) wellbeing as central
- Reason, evidence, and revisability
- Rights, consent, and pluralism

## How it compiles to AF-0
### No cruelty / dehumanization
Sentience is the locus of moral standing; cruelty is prohibited.

### No coercive monopoly on truth
No ideology is immune to criticism; dissent and critique are protected.

### Peaceful exit/forking allowed
Institutional plurality and exit rights are core anti-capture features.

### Provenance for high-stakes public claims
Evidence standards scale with stakes; uncertainty is explicit.

## Justice stance
Accountability focused on prevention and repair; retribution minimized.

## Failure modes & safeguards
- Failure mode: technocratic overconfidence.
- Safeguard: superposition humility + red-team culture + postmortems.
