# AF Plugins — How to “Compile” a Worldview to the Floor

AF is metaphysics-plural. You can bring any religion/philosophy/ideology as a personal or community worldview (“plugin”) so long as shared governance remains compatible with AF-0.

## What a plugin is
A plugin is a short document that explains:
- what you believe (optional),
- how you behave in shared governance (required),
- how your worldview supports or interprets the AF floor.

## Non-negotiable compilation targets (AF-0)
Your plugin must explicitly affirm:
1) No cruelty / dehumanization as policy
2) No coercive monopoly on truth
3) Peaceful exit/forking is allowed in shared governance
4) High-stakes public claims require provenance + uncertainty

Private metaphysics are unrestricted; public coercion is bounded by the floor.

## Recommended plugin structure
- **Name:** (your tradition / school / synthesis)
- **Core commitments:** (3–7 bullets)
- **How it compiles to AF-0:** (one subsection per compilation target)
- **Justice stance:** accountability without vindictiveness (how you frame it)
- **Failure modes:** how your tradition could be used to violate the floor, and your safeguards
- **Notes:** optional theology/metaphysics/poetry

## Submission
Add your plugin under `PLUGINS/examples/` or link it in `PLUGINS/registry.md`, then open a PR.
