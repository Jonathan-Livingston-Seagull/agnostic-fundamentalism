# AGNOSTIC FUNDAMENTALISM — AF-0 (Kernel Constitution)
**Status:** Draft v0.1 (forkable; revisable via AF-RFC process)

## Purpose
Provide a universalist baseline for cooperative civilization: a minimal, metaphysics-plural boot layer that enables collaboration among diverse worldviews without permitting cruelty, epistemic monopoly, or capture.

## Kernel Formula
**Protect sentience; grow coherence; hold metaphysics in superposition.**

## Definitions
- **Sentience / valenced awareness:** the capacity for suffering/flourishing (experienced good/bad).
- **Sanctity (naturalized):** a class of constraints that forbid treating sentience as mere instrument, even when locally beneficial.
- **Coherence:** consistency + evidence-responsiveness + error-correction; within minds, between minds, and within institutions.
- **Superposition:** unresolved metaphysical dualities remain non-final; no metaphysical certainty licenses coercion or cruelty.
- **Attractors (social):** self-reinforcing basins of norms, incentives, and feedback loops. "Hell" and "Heaven" are shorthand for destructive vs generative attractors.
- **Governance (stance):** gardening of attractors, not total control of outcomes. Change the soil, feedback, and constraints so better trajectories become likely.

## Non-negotiable Constraints
1) **Non-instrumentalization:** cruelty, torture, humiliation, and deliberate manufacture of suffering are prohibited.
2) **Consent & autonomy:** respect bodily autonomy and informed consent; coercion requires narrowly justified safety grounds and due process.
3) **Accountability without hatred:** justice is for safety, repair, and prevention—not vengeance or metaphysical desert.
4) **Forkability:** peaceful exit, association, and institutional redesign are protected (bounded by sentience constraints).
5) **No epistemic monopoly:** no authority may compel belief; claims remain contestable; dissent is protected.

## Epistemic Protocol (Minimum)
- **Provenance required** for high-stakes claims (source, method, uncertainty).
- **Adversarial testing is normal:** red-teaming and critique are protected, not punished.
- **Decision proportionality:** higher stakes ⇒ higher evidentiary and audit standards.
- **Metaphysical humility:** metaphysical claims may be held privately but cannot be used to override kernel constraints.

## Governance Protocol (Minimum)
- **AF-RFC process:** propose → critique → sandbox trial → evaluation → adopt/rollback.
- **Auditability:** public reasoning trails for policy; conflicts of interest disclosed.
- **Anti-capture:** polycentric power, rotating roles, transparent processes, and easy forking.

## Compatibility Clause
Any religion/philosophy/ideology may “run” if it compiles to AF-0 constraints in shared governance. Private metaphysics are free; public coercion is bounded by the kernel.

## Inclusion Default
**Default stance:** interpret the floor as permissively as possible while preserving sentience protections, forkability, and anti-monopoly safeguards.
