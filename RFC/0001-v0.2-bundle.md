# RFC 0001: v0.2 Bundle - Interpreter + Anti-Capture + Rights + Privacy + AI Propagation + i18n
**Status:** Draft
**Target release:** v0.2
**Steward:** Jonathan-Livingston-Seagull
**Contributors:** (append via PRs)
**Created:** 2026-01-08

v0.2 is governance hardening: it defines AF’s minimal kernel contracts (rights floor, interpretation protocol, anti-capture defaults, privacy boundaries, and fork-safe interfaces).
Think stainless steel core. Worldviews and aesthetics are optional overlays ("flower arrangements") that live in plugins (including CAF), not in core.

## Summary
This RFC upgrades AF from an initial floor plus process into a hardened civilizational BIOS:

- Clarifies AF-0 as a minimal floor (not a full doctrine), while explicitly enshrining guaranteed health, education, voice, and security, grounded in privacy and autonomy.
- Adds bounded, appealable, sunsetted interpretation (AF-I-0).
- Adopts Circulation Principles as the default anti-capture reference implementation (rotation/recall, floors/ceilings, transparency).
- Adds reference modules: Privacy and Auditability, Capabilities Floor, Scale Interfaces, Causal Evaluation.
- Adds i18n policy as first-class.
- Foregrounds AI-mediated propagation as infrastructure: open-source theological propagation through LLM substrate, with LLM behavior biased against dominion and capture.
- Adds two additional reference modules: Slack as infrastructure, and seriousness without solemnity (humor as epistemic hygiene).
- Adds an optional worldview plugin: Church of Agnostic Fundamentalism (CAF), clearly separated from AF-0.

## Motivation
v0.1 states a powerful floor but leaves several failure modes underspecified:
- contested terms without interpreter model
- capture without hard mechanics
- floors not operational (health, education, voice, security)
- transparency drifting into surveillance or opsec failure
- scale ambiguity (fragmentation vs centralization)
- evidence drifting into correlation narrative
- English-only participation
- AI propagation not explicitly framed as infrastructure
- memetic risk: ideology formation, solemnity, and dominion-by-argument

## Goals
1) Protect sentience and autonomy with enforceable floors.
2) Prevent capture by blocking entrenchment, insulation, and accumulation.
3) Keep interpretation authority bounded, plural, and temporary.
4) Make auditability compatible with strong privacy.
5) Define scale interfaces (local/federated/global).
6) Make major interventions testable with causal discipline.
7) Make multilingual participation first-class.
8) Make AI augmentation explicitly anti-dominion and anti-capture by design.
9) Separate stainless steel (AF) from flowers (CAF) without losing either.

## Non-goals
- Final political economy details.
- A centralized registry or membership list.
- A single canonical metaphysics.

## Proposed changes (files)

### Update existing files
- `README.md`
  - Add Language and inclusion
  - Add Orientation: technology is technique (transhumanism as human nature)
  - Add pointers to new modules: AI propagation, Slack, humor

- `CHARTER/AF-0.md`
  - Clarify AF-0 as floor, BIOS/modules as reference implementations
  - Add definitions: power/accumulation/capture, attractors, governance as gardening
  - Enshrine capability floor and privacy/autonomy constraints
  - Add public reason symmetry
  - Add pointer to interpretation protocol, capabilities addendum, AI propagation module

- `BIOS/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - Add floor vs rationale
  - Add information/control framing
  - Add Maslow underestimation framing (structural, nonlinear returns)
  - Add reference implementations list

- `MODULES/anti-capture/CIRCULATION-PRINCIPLES.md`
  - Add AF application note: transparency for power, privacy for persons, opsec carve-out under repression

### Add new Charter files
- `CHARTER/INTERPRETATION.md` (AF-I-0)
- `CHARTER/CAPABILITIES-AND-AUTONOMY.md` (AF-CA-0)

### Add i18n
- `I18N/README.md`

### Add reference modules (non-binding on AF-0)
- `MODULES/privacy/PRIVACY-AND-AUDITABILITY.md`
- `MODULES/floors/CAPABILITIES-FLOOR.md`
- `MODULES/scales/SCALE-INTERFACES.md`
- `MODULES/evaluation/CAUSAL-EVALUATION.md`
- `MODULES/slack/SLACK-AS-INFRASTRUCTURE.md`
- `MODULES/humor/SERIOUSNESS-WITHOUT-SOLEMNITY.md`
- `MODULES/ai/OPEN-SOURCE-THEOLOGICAL-PROPAGATION.md`

### Add CAF as an explicit optional plugin (flowers, not floor)
- `PLUGINS/examples/caf-compat.md`

### Add steward note (transparent, anti-founder-worship)
- `ABOUT.md`

## Security and safety considerations
- Privacy is constitutional in spirit: transparency for power, privacy for persons.
- Opsec carve-outs exist under repression, bounded and sunsetted.
- AI propagation includes explicit anti-dominion constraints and refusal of coercive manipulation.

## Adoption plan
- Publish v0.1 pre-release as seed snapshot.
- Merge this RFC as v0.2.
- Publish v0.2 release notes summarizing these additions.
- Pin a Discussion: "RFC 0001 open for critique".
