# AF BIOS Architecture
**Status:** Draft v0.1

## Layered view
- **Layer 0: Kernel (AF-0)** - invariants + minimal protocols
- **Layer 1: BIOS Services** - always-on civic services
- **Layer 2: Plugins** - religions/ideologies/economic models/constitutions
- **Layer 3: Applications** - agencies, programs, communities, projects

## BIOS services (always-on)

### A) Reality Sync Service (Epistemic)
- Provenance + uncertainty required for high-stakes claims
- Protected red-team lanes and whistleblowing
- Forecast/postmortem practice where stakes justify it

### B) Sentience Protection Service (Rights Floor)
- Anti-cruelty, due process, consent constraints
- Precaution protocol for uncertain sentience boundaries (animals, impaired humans, novel AIs):
  - graded protections
  - monitoring
  - sunset reviews

### C) Justice Service (Accountability)
- Separate functions:
  - containment (safety)
  - repair (restitution/reconciliation when feasible)
  - rehabilitation (capability building)
  - deterrence (least-harmful effective)
- Prohibit hatred-as-justice and humiliation as governance tools

### D) Incentive Service (Anti-Goodhart)
- Metrics are sensors, not truth
- Multi-metric dashboards, gaming audits, kill-switches
- Recognition is a collective changelog (Kudos Ledger), not a points economy

### E) Governance Service (Forkability + Capture Resistance)
- Polycentric power; no single point of failure
- Transparent processes and audits
- Fork/exit rights bounded by sentience protections

### F) Education Service (Civic Competence)
- Epistemic literacy (probability, bias, disagreement)
- Consent culture and conflict skills
- “How to patch the system” training

## Plugin interface (“compiles to AF-0”)
A plugin must:
1) Respect sentience protections (no cruelty license)
2) Use provenance/uncertainty standards for high-stakes public claims
3) Accept revisability via AF-RFC + audits (no coercive epistemic monopoly)
4) Preserve peaceful exit/forking in shared governance

## Key invariants
- No cruelty license
- No unchallengeable authority
- No un-audited power

## Threat model (summary)
- **Capture / priesthood formation:** mitigate with transparency, rotation, protected dissent
- **Goodharting:** mitigate with multi-metric + audits + kill-switches + postmortems
- **Coercive monopoly moves:** mitigate with rights floor + fork rights + accountability
- **Centralization:** mitigate with polycentric/federated design
- **Boundary failure (“compassion” becomes permissiveness):** keep humane containment real
