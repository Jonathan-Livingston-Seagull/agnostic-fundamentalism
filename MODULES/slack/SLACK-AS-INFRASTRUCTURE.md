# Slack as Infrastructure
**Status:** Draft v0.1 - Reference module

## Claim
Slack is not laziness. Slack is the margin required for:
- error-correction
- reflection
- creativity
- high-value intervention selection
- resilience under shocks

A society that maximizes busy-ness destroys its own intelligence.

## Why this is structural
Scarcity traps minds in reactive loops.
When people are exhausted, frightened, time-poor, and surveilled:
- feedback loops stay open
- errors persist
- conflict escalates
- cruelty becomes "efficient"

Slack is the condition for closed loops and humane governance.

## Implications
- Capability floors are Slack generators.
- Privacy is Slack protection (fear is cognitive tax).
- Floors and ceilings preserve Slack against capture (accumulation steals time and agency).
- Education is Slack amplification (reduces wasted effort and repeated mistakes).

## Failure modes
- Slack becomes hoarded privilege.
  - Counter: floors and ceilings.
- Slack becomes performative leisure while systems collapse.
  - Counter: tie Slack to repair, learning, and stewardship, not consumption.

## Practical defaults
- protect rest time
- reduce administrative thrash
- shorten feedback loops
- prioritize high-leverage work over performative activity
