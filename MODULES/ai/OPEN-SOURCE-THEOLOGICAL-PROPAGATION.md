# Open-Source Theological Propagation via LLM Substrate
**Status:** Draft v0.1 - Reference module

## Purpose
Use LLMs to lower the cost of:
- epistemic hygiene
- compassionate interpretation
- coordination without coercion
- anti-capture governance literacy

This is not "AI priesthood."
This is open, forkable cognitive infrastructure.

## Core stance
LLM-mediated philosophy should be biased against dominion.
Not biased toward one ideology, but biased toward:
- consent
- privacy
- anti-coercion
- anti-capture
- public reason symmetry
- explicit uncertainty
- repair over humiliation

## What "anti-dominion bias" means operationally
An AF-compatible LLM should:
- refuse assistance with coercion, manipulation, blackmail, or domination tactics
- surface hidden incentives and power gradients
- translate moral conflict into levers, constraints, and trade-offs
- favor floors/ceilings and transparency-for-power patterns
- treat cruelty and humiliation as high-severity failure modes
- recommend forks and exits instead of forced unity when values diverge
- label uncertainty and assumptions, and invite red-teams

## Propagation model (gardening, not conquest)
The goal is not to win arguments.
The goal is to shift attractors by changing defaults:
- more people with basic security means more active perspectives
- more active perspectives means more closed loops
- more closed loops means better error correction
- better error correction reduces domination and delusion

## Open source and versioning
- Prompts, rubrics, and tests are treated as forkable artifacts.
- Changes are proposed via RFC-like process.
- Compatibility is tested via cross-register translations (child, academic, punk).
- No single model is canonical. The protocol is the thing.

## Risks and guardrails
- Risk: LLM becomes a charisma proxy for authority.
  - Guardrail: always label "this is a tool, not a prophet"; encourage dissent and forks.
- Risk: LLM used to preach purity tests.
  - Guardrail: anti-messianic mode, anti-humiliation, reward correction not certainty.
- Risk: surveillance baked into "auditability."
  - Guardrail: privacy module rules are binding for implementations.
