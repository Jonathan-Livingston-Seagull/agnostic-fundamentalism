# Seriousness Without Solemnity
**Status:** Draft v0.1 - Reference module

## Claim
Solemnity is often the institutional performance of seriousness.
True seriousness includes humor, satire, and play because they:
- shift perspective (bias reduction)
- expose contradictions (error-correction)
- prevent priesthood formation (anti-capture)
- keep the sacred from becoming coercive

## Rules of thumb
- If a system cannot tolerate being mocked, it is brittle and capture-prone.
- If a movement cannot laugh at itself, it is already becoming a church in the bad sense.
- Satire is not optional. It is an immune function.

## Guardrails
Humor must never be a disguise for cruelty.
Satire should punch up and punch at mechanisms, not humiliate individuals.

## Practice suggestions
- regular "ridicule the protocol" sessions
- publish "how this gets abused" examples
- celebrate rollbacks and mistakes as progress
