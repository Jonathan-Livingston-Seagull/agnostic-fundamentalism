# Justice Module - Accountability Without Vindictiveness
**Status:** Draft v0.1

## Purpose
Justice exists to reduce present and future harm, and to repair what can be repaired. It is not a mechanism for metaphysical vengeance.

## Core distinctions
- **Accountability:** truth, boundaries, restitution, and safety measures grounded in causal responsibility.
- **Vindictiveness:** punishment whose purpose is suffering, humiliation, or “desert satisfaction.”

## Allowed / Required
1) **Containment (safety):** humane restriction when necessary to prevent harm.
2) **Repair:** restitution, reconciliation, restoration where possible.
3) **Rehabilitation:** evidence-based support to reduce recurrence.
4) **Deterrence:** least harmful effective deterrence, monitored and revised.
5) **Due process:** clear procedure, right to appeal, protection from retaliation.

## Disallowed
- Cruelty as policy tool
- Humiliation rituals
- Hatred-as-justice
- Punishment justified by certainty about “ultimate desert” or metaphysical free will

## Default stance
- Prefer rehabilitation-first pathways where safety permits.
- Use minimal necessary harm in containment/deterrence.
- Treat recurring harm as a systems problem (environment, incentives, support), not a license for cruelty.

## Positive reinforcement (“kudos”)
- Celebrate verified reductions in harm and increases in coherence (truthfulness, repair, restraint, interoperable institution-building).
- Avoid score economies; use collective changelog entries (Kudos Ledger).
- Reinforcement without metaphysical pride: praise outcomes and effort-quality without turning it into supremacy narratives.

## Anti-Goodhart guardrail
- Rewards must be tethered to evidence, revisable criteria, and audit.
- When incentives distort behavior, revise the metric/process, not reality.
