# AF Bootable MVP — Spec v0.1
**Purpose:** Demonstrate AF-0 working in a real community with measurable outcomes (not vibes).  
**Scale:** 50–500 participants (online-first; local chapters optional).  
**Success condition:** diverse metaphysics cooperate without coercion; conflicts resolve with low humiliation and low recurrence; governance evolves via RFC rather than power plays; forks are peaceful.

---

## 1) MVP commitments (the floor applies here)
- AF-0 is the constitution (CHARTER/AF-0.md).
- No cruelty, dehumanization, epistemic monopoly, or suppression of peaceful exit/forking.
- High-stakes decisions require provenance and explicit uncertainty.

---

## 2) Minimal “services” to ship (in this order)

### A) Onboarding + consent norms
- A short onboarding doc: “what this is / isn’t” + “how disputes work” + “how to exit/fork”.
- Explicit anti-humiliation norm.

### B) Dispute routing (three lanes)
1) **Empirical disputes:** testable claims → evidence, forecasts, postmortems.
2) **Value disputes:** negotiate, trial, or fork (no forced unity).
3) **Conduct harms:** accountability lane (repair + safety + due process).

### C) Mediation capacity
- 3–12 rotating mediators (trained; no permanent priesthood).
- Cooling-off protocol for escalations.

### D) AF-RFC pipeline
- Proposals become RFCs when high-stakes.
- Sandbox trials + sunset dates whenever feasible.

### E) Kudos Ledger (collective changelog)
- Outcomes + postmortems, not a points economy.
- Failure/rollback quota enforced.

---

## 3) Minimal “justice” operating rules
- Accountability is allowed/required; vindictiveness is prohibited.
- Containment is humane and minimal necessary.
- Repair and rehabilitation are defaults when safety permits.
- Clear due process + appeals.

---

## 4) Measurements (simple, auditable)
These are sensors, not truth; treat them as fallible and revise as needed.

### Harm & conflict
- Time-to-resolution
- Recurrence rate of similar incidents
- Humiliation proxy (post-incident survey: “I felt degraded/attacked as a person”)
- Fairness proxy (survey: “process felt fair / I could appeal”)

### Coherence
- Forecast calibration (where used): simple Brier score trend
- Postmortem completion rate
- Provenance compliance for high-stakes claims

### Interoperability & capture resistance
- Dissent safety survey (“can I disagree without retaliation?”)
- Role rotation compliance
- Audit findings (count + severity)

---

## 5) MVP success criteria (boot = “it runs”)
- At least 3 worldview “plugins” are active in the community with low friction.
- Conflicts are resolved without humiliation as a tool.
- At least one RFC is accepted via process (and ideally one rollback happens cleanly).
- Exit/fork occurs at least once without hostility (optional but strong signal).

---

## 6) MVP failure criteria (shutdown / redesign triggers)
- Coercive epistemic monopoly attempts (suppressed dissent, loyalty tests)
- Repeated dehumanization/cruelty tolerated or normalized
- Metrics become a status economy (Goodhart spiral)
- Permanent un-audited authority emerges

---

## 7) First 30 days (suggested cadence)
- Week 1: onboarding + conduct + dispute lanes
- Week 2: mediator training + RFC pipeline live
- Week 3: first RFC trial (low stakes)
- Week 4: publish first ledger entry + first postmortem + first audit checklist
